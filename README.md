## Customization

### Site Configuration
Edit `SITE_CONFIG` in `src/DirectorySite.jsx`:

```javascript
const SITE_CONFIG = {
  title: "Your Company",
  tagline: "Your value proposition",
  guarantee: "Your guarantee message",
  supportEmail: "support@yourcompany.com",
  currency: "USD",
};
```

### Styling
- All styles are inline for maximum portability

### Pricing Logic
Modify `computePrice()` function in `src/DirectorySite.jsx`:

```javascript
function computePrice(basePrice, score, exclusivity) {
  const mult = exclusivity === "Exclusive" ? 2.5 : 1;
  const raw = (Number(basePrice || 25) * (Number(score || 60) / 80)) * mult;
  return Math.round(clamp(raw, 15, 150));
}
```
